Structuring Information

1. Problems

- rigidity through fixed markup.

problem: As knowledge grows, it has to be structured. Subtopics get expanded 
and demand their own files. This necessitates wide-ranging changes in markdown, 
which is cumbersome.

solution: indentation

indentation problems: gets cumbersome to edit, requires zooming
implementation: workflowy, all other implentations unusable

no orientation in formatted text as you don't know the meaning of a specific markup

problem: As a document grows, it becomes more difficult to know what certain markup indicates. For example, you might not know what the difference is between bold text and italic text as a heading style in a long document

solution: keep documents shorts so that they required 3 levels at maximum

solution: use numbers
problem: fixed markup, keep track of numbering, numbering distracting

1. option: use combination of Caps, numbers and files
2. option: use combination of markup and files

use combination of unordered and ordered lists

use keywords

use spacing

outline thinking

think of outline beforehand

write down outline 

Roman numerals as top-level numbering, then decimal

split into files, also possibility
